# quick

`quick` is the simple trainer built on the top of `pytorch` & `deepspeed` for making my deep learning model training more smoother & faster.

**Note: This trainer is inspired from `pytorch-lightning Trainer` & `huggingface Trainer`. I wanted to have more control on how I train, therefore I made this.**
